# MUSICPATH should point to the directory where your music files are kept.
# Ideally the directory structure will be /MUSICPATH/artist/album/filename,
# as in /MUSICPATH/The Beatles/Revolver/Yellow Submarine.flac, as this will
# make the process of importing files into the database easier.
# Any zipfiles selected for importing will be extracted to MUSICPATH

# DOWNLOADSPATH has a button shortcut on the page for importing files to
# the database. The import process will not move the files from
# your Downloads directory, although any imported zipfiles will be extracted
# to MUSICPATH. You should therefore move files (other than zipfiles)
# to their intended final location before you import them into the
# database. If you change their location after importing them, you
# will need to delete them from the database and import them again,
# otherwise their filenames will be invalid.
